# What's Cooking?

Whats cooking?
>An interesting data set fromÂ kaggle where we have each row as a unique dish belonging to one cuisine and and each dish with its set of ingredients.
```
For example -
{
"id": 10259,
"cuisine": "greek",
"ingredients": [
"romaine lettuce",
"black olives",
"grape tomatoes",
"garlic",
"pepper",
"purple onion",
"seasoning",
"garbanzo beans",
"feta cheese crumbles"
]
}
```
There are 20 ingredients here, so based on the ingredients can we predict the cuisine? 

* The data has been taken from [What's Cooking? Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking-kernels-only) 

*Note: the project uses only Python 3.X and above for analysis*
